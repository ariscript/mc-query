Implementations of [Server List ping](https://wiki.vg/Server_List_Ping), [Query](https://wiki.vg/Query), and [RCON](https://wiki.vg/RCON) using the Minecraft networking protocol.

Maybe in the future there will be a CLI to access these features as well.

## Installation

To use this library, just run `cargo add mc-query`.

## Usage

You can read the docs [here](https://docs.rs/mc-query).

## Examples

### Using `status` to get basic server information

```rs
use mc_query::status;
use tokio::io::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let data = status("mc.hypixel.net", 25565).await?;
    println!("{data:#?}");

    Ok(())
}
```

### Using `RconClient` to run commands via RCON

```rs
use mc_query::rcon::RconClient;
use tokio::io::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let mut client = RconClient::new("localhost", 25565);
    client.authenticate("supersecretrconpassword").await?;

    let response = client.run_command("time set 0").await?;
    println!("{response}");

    Ok(())
}
```

### Using `stat_basic` to query the server

```rs
use mc_query::query;
use tokio;:io::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let res = stat_basic("localhost", 25565).await?;
    println!(
       "Server has {} out of {} players online",
       res.num_players,
       res.max_players
    );
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Testing

Some tests in this library require a minecraft server to be running on `localhost`.
If you are contributing a feature or bugfix that involves one of these tests,
run the convienient testing script `./test` (or `py -3 test` on Windows).
You can also just run a minecraft server without the cargo tests (useful for debugging with IDEs) with `./test --server-only true`.

This requires a decently modern version of Python 3, and Java 17 or higher to run the server.
